# Portfolio
## description
    I created a portfolio describing my work experience and the work i completed in the bootcamp. There is an about page that describes my back story. The portfolio is completely interactive and provides my information to contact me. 

## Content
    This portfolio was built from the ground up. all code in the html and css was done by me to meet the acceptance criteria of this assignment. The html and css are properly applied to eachother and is in working condition. Html semantics were used where needed to ease the reading of the code itself.
