          <p> My name is Daniel Van Kirk, I was born in the country of Guatemala. I was adopted and brought to the united strategies
            at a very young age. I grew up in the state of Connecticut where i attended public school for the majority of my childhood. 
            When I reached highschool, I attended a private catholic highschool which gave me a fantastic education. Once I graduated from
            highschool, I attended St. Lawrence University where i majored in a medical field. My goal at this time was to go through medical
            school and become a doctor. Due to personal reasons I had to leave the school and ended up attending Mitchell College in New London, CT.
            My father was the head of the criminal justice department at that school so i decided to make that my major. I spent a year and a half at Mitchell College
            before I decided to move down to Florida. I continued my degree at Seminole state college where I graduated with an associates degree.
            Shortly after graduating I decided to attend the police academy at Seminole State College. I completed the academy but was uncesseful in 
            gaining employment at a police department. I applied to UCF and began furthering my education in the criminal justice field.
            after a year of attending UCF, I began applying to police departments again which resulted in me becoming a police officer for the 
            city of Winter Springs. I spent a year at the department gaining life skills that i would never gain in any other job. I experienced 
            high stress situations to simple situations that required people skills that i built. Being a police officer is a life changing experience that i 
            would not trade for anything else. But, i started to lose interest in the job which made me start looking for other jobs. I stumbled across the coding career.
            I have always had a knack for building things since i was young like legos. I also had an interest in how things are made since i can rember. When i was younger,
            me and my father would always watch the show "How things are made." I decided to do some research and made the commitment to complete the UCF coding bootcamp.
